It is an international centre of business, finance, arts, and culture, and is recognized as one of the most multicultural and cosmopolitan cities in the world. The diverse population of Toronto reflects its current and historical role as an important destination for immigrants to Canada. Over 200 distinct ethnic origins are represented among its inhabitants and while the majority of population speak English as their primary language, over 160 languages are spoken in the city.\n\nGiven the population and diversity of Toronto, the market is mostly saturated and leads to a competitive environment for business owners.
